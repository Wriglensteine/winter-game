At the start of the expedition draw one neutral card from the top of the deck and reveal it. Upon revealing an expedition card on the track you may exchange it with your neutral card and use its effects instead. This can be done once per expedition.
Once per expedition you may peak at an unrevealed expedition card. This does not trigger the effect of that card and may be described or shown to other players.
You may reroll a tool roll on an expedition you are on once per expedition.
You and other players on an expedition you are on may ignore the first blood drop penalty.
